# Runbook for hosting LiveG Lookahead
As a host for LiveG Lookahead, read this guide to see what tasks you need to complete.

1. **Select ideas from the #lookahead-ideas channel on Discord** (Monday)<br>
  Mark chosen ideas using ✅ reaction. 3 ideas that do not have the ✅ reaction must be selected. The highest-liked ideas are preferrable; if equal, then choose ideas that either have the most messages in a thread or are the oldest.

2. **Create an agenda file in this repo**<br>
  Copy the format from the last agenda. Ensure that the readme is updated to link to the new agenda, too. The meeting date for the episode after next should also be added to the readme list.

3. **Create YouTube livestream**<br>
  Should copy the previous livestream's details and modify accordingly.

4. **Update OBS agenda details**<br>
  This includes the **Agenda** scene and the agenda items' respective highlight scenes, in addition to updating the **Welcome** scene and **End** scene with the correct dates.

5. **Create Discord event**<br>
  Title and description should be a copy of what is shown on livestream. Adding the main LiveG Lookahead cover image is nice.

6. **Inform of next next meeting on Twitter and Mastodon**<br>
  Take a 1080p screenshot of the **Agenda** scene and upload to Twitter and Mastodon. Copy loosely the same post contents as the previous meeting's. Ensure alt text is added.

7. **Take detailed notes of agenda plan** (Tuesday)<br>
  This should not be shared publicly; is only used for reference by the host/staff only.
  
8. **Remind scheduled speakers that event will start** (16:30)<br>
  This is to ensure that speakers join in good time. The host should join the LiveG Lookahead voice channel.

9. **Start OBS for pre-stream checks** (16:30)<br>
  Check slides are correct and that microphone and audio output capture is working correctly. Start streaming to YouTube (don't go live yet). Planned speakers should join between 16:30 and 16:45 to test their microphone.

10. **Go live onto YouTube** (16:45)<br>
  The **Starting Soon** scene should remain shown until 17:00. All planned speakers may chat in preparation for the stream; YouTube viewers will not be able to hear this.

11. **Start event** (17:00)<br>
  Go through usual meeting format, begining with meeting notices, then introductions, then the agenda.

12. **Finish meeting**<br>
  Close off meeting and show **End** scene for around 5 minutes before stopping the YouTube stream.

13. **Add recording link to this repo's readme**<br>
  Other convenience preparations such as updating dates in the OBS scenes can optionally be performed now.

14. **Come up with ideas for next Lookahead**<br>
  This can be done ideally before Sunday; with ideas posted to the #lookahead-ideas channel.
