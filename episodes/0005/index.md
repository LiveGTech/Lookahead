## Agenda
* **Use cases for LiveG Proton modularity (James Livesey)**<br>
  Having discussed about the design of the LiveG Proton in [our previous episode](https://github.com/LiveGTech/Lookahead/blob/main/episodes/0004/index.md), we'll be talking about what modular devices we should build that can connect to the Proton to enhance its hardware functionality.

* **Designing decentralised cloud storage (tramcrazy)**<br>
  We'll be discussing about how we should architect a decentralised cloud storage system that lets users turn their devices into networked file storage accessible over the internet. We'll be giving an overview of our current plans and any refinements to be made to our current design.

* **Planning our roadmap for LiveG OS (James Livesey)**<br>
  With builds of LiveG OS for the Raspberry Pi and PinePhone nearing closer to completion, we'll be looking at what will be next for LiveG OS to further expand its feature set and make it a more useful operating system for daily use. We'll be planning what will be going into the next release of LiveG OS.
