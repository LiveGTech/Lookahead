## Agenda
* **Making PWAs installable in LiveG OS (James Livesey)**<br>
  With LiveG OS's development maturing at a good pace, we will be discussing how users will be able to install the apps they use daily as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) on LiveG OS. We'll also be talking about how to implement app permissions to ensure that the user and the system is protected against malicious apps.

* **Marketing our OS: choosing the best time (James Livesey)**<br>
  We've already built a good reputation for what we've been doing, but we hope to expand. We'll be discussing about how we can build on our current influence as an organisation that is developing its own operating system, and in turn gain potential early adopters of LiveG OS who will be the key to its popularity.

* **Defining our values at LiveG (James Livesey)**<br>
  We'll be discussing about what sets us apart from other organisations who have similar ambitions in both a moral and ethical sense. We'll be focusing on fighting the climate crisis with the right to repair; ensuring user privacy and data ownership; and diversity and inclusion through leading accessibility practices.
