The meeting is to be held on Discord under the **LiveG Lookahead** channel. Everyone is welcome to attend and watch the meeting. Attendees may participate by asking questions or providing input to the discussion via the #lookahead channel.

The meeting will also be livestreamed to YouTube where questions and discussion input can also be left in the chat, though there may be some delay before we respond to your messages due to the nature of livestreaming. A recording of the meeting will be available after it has finished.

Questions and input can be given at any time, and we aim to address all questions and input at the end of the meeting if we don't address them during the discussion.

## Agenda
* **An update on LiveG OS 0.2.0 (James Livesey)**<br>
  With all the planned features having been implemented into our upcoming Alpha release of LiveG OS, we'll be reporting the progress over the past few weeks with bringing the system closer to public release by building and testing it for multiple platforms.

* **Getting ready for our next Showcase (James Livesey)**<br>
  We will soon need to create our next episode of LiveG Showcase to publicly announce the new version of LiveG OS. We'll be covering what has already been done for this episode, and what will need to be produced and included in the video to ensure it contains information on all the changes we've implemented.

* **Choosing what's next for LiveG OS (James Livesey)**<br>
  After the release of LiveG OS 0.2.0, we'll be beginning work on version 0.3.0. We'll be dicussing what features we should include and prioritise in this next update based on previous discussions on LiveG Lookahead, and we'll be reviewing what features to add to our long-term roadmap in general.
