## Meeting access
The meeting is to be held on Discord under the **LiveG Lookahead** channel. Everyone is welcome to attend and watch the meeting. Attendees may participate by asking questions or providing input to the discussion via the #lookahead channel.

The meeting will also be livestreamed to YouTube where questions and discussion input can also be left in the chat, though there may be some delay before we respond to your messages due to the nature of livestreaming. A recording of the meeting will be available after it has finished.

Questions and input can be given at any time, and we aim to address all questions and input at the end of the meeting if we don't address them during the discussion.

## Agenda
* **Our path to releasing our first products (James Livesey)**<br>
  An overview of our current planned product line and a talk about what devices we should release first and how we should release them to the public. We'll also be discussing about how we should plan our OS feature and security updates.

* **Building a decentralised online storage service (James Livesey)**<br>
  With our projects being largely web-based, it would be great to enhance their functionality by providing access to them through the internet. We'll be talking about the ways we could let users potentially access files from other devices over the web.

* **Planning our eigth birthday on the 30th (James Livesey)**<br>
  A discussion about what we should do to celebrate eight years of LiveG since its beginnings in 2014. We plan to review the past year of LiveG's projects and development and share the highlights of how far we've come.
